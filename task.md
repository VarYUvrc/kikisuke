# Task Checklist: Voice-to-Text Web Application with Reflex

## 1. Initial Setup & Research
- [x] Create this task management file (`task.md`).
- [ ] Research Reflex framework basics:
    - [ ] Component library (e.g., buttons, text display).
    - [ ] State management (`rx.State`).
    - [ ] Event handling (`on_click`, etc.).
    - [ ] How to integrate custom JavaScript.
- [x] Research a Python library for speech-to-text transcription. **Decision: Use the `SpeechRecognition` library.**
- [x] Research a JavaScript library for browser-side audio recording. **Decision: Use the native `MediaStream Recording API`.**

## 2. Backend Development
- [x] Set up the basic Reflex application structure in `kikisuke/kikisuke.py`.
- [x] Define the main `State` for the application to manage transcription text and recording status.
- [x] Implement an API route (`rx.api`) to receive audio data from the frontend.
- [x] Add the chosen speech-to-text library to the project dependencies.
- [x] Implement the transcription logic that processes the received audio data and updates the state.

## 3. Frontend Development
- [x] Create the basic UI layout.
- [x] Add a button to start/stop voice recording.
- [x] Add a display area to show the transcribed text.
- [x] Add a status indicator (e.g., "Recording...", "Click to start").

## 4. JavaScript Integration for Audio Recording
- [x] Write JavaScript code to:
    - [x] Access the user's microphone (`getUserMedia`).
    - [x] Record audio when the button is clicked.
    - [x] Stop recording and package the audio data (e.g., as a Blob).
    - [x] Send the audio Blob to the backend API endpoint using `fetch`.
- [x] Load and trigger this custom JavaScript from the Reflex application.

## 5. Finalization & Testing
- [x] Connect all the pieces: UI, State, JavaScript, and backend logic.
- [ ] Test the full workflow in a browser.
- [ ] Refine the UI/UX and error handling.
